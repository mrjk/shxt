# Rationale

We cover here some advanced topics.

## Rationale

### Why this strange release process

Because this is actually possible.

### Single source file

This make life easier:
* simple to maintain
* try to keep code simple and minimal
* reduced dowload times because smaller files
* super simple but unlock unlimited possibilities

### Bash and not POSIX

Maybe later. Eventually. Why not ?

### Bash and not other

Please reimplement it yourself for your favorite shell :-) I'll post a link here.
